this is a runthrough of the mysql with python tutorial on tutorialspoint

first create database in phpmy admin
go to privileges and add user account to add user with password
fill in user name and password and host type. user: testuser pw: test123

select all for data and structure and nothing for admin and go.
this will show up in privileges

pip3 install PyMySQL then import into file with lowercase in db_connect.py 
enter stuff you need to connect

the create db_create_table.py to create table employee in db
there will be unknown table warning first time, but after it will just overwrite

now create db_insert_into_table.py and insert statically into sql table

then edit that to be dynamic

create db_update.py and update the ages of all males

create db_read.py and read 

create db_delete.py and delete 21 year olds from db

now you know the basics
